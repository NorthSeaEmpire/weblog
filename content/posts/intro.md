Grettings, if you happened upon this blog (without knowing me personally or given the link by me) via the interweb....you have waaaay too much free time on your hands
but, hopefully I can provide some interesting knowledge for your efforts.

## About Me

Currently I am a cybersecurity engineer. My primary background is in offensive security but I do all sorts of stuff related to the field. 
Iv'e done some more niche research in the field such as satellite security and android OS security. I am by  no means an expert but,
I fint it interesting nevertheless. Even though I am trying to move away from the security industry I may post infomation about sats and android here (from my own personal research).
There isn't a lot of info about sats in particular on the internet and there can be a few misconceptions to clear up as well. My main goal is to switch industries to 
game design and development.

My other intrests outside of tech include: cooking, coffee, history, writing, photography, traveling, and scheming >:)

## Posting
My main reason for the blog is to document my attempt at indie game development. I'll try to keep weekly posts, mainly to keep myself modavated. 
However, I will probably post things about my other intrests too. Basically whatever I find interesting will go here.
