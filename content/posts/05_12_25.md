## I'm Back

"weekly postings" well that was a lie wasn't it? 

A **lot** has happened, forseeing layoffs and being rather unhappy with my previous work I ended up leaving my job in Febuary. Then I pretty much spent the next 2 months in Japan to try help clear any burnout. For like the 2 people who actually read this I'm not stopping and should get back to posting. I'd like to do guides as well at somepoint. Spring has been quite a trial. I have made little progress in game development and I am not particularly happy with my new place of work either (mainly a location issue). Still money is money so I won't complain too much. I still don't have a place to live because my new job required relocation to the middle of nowhere so it's hotel life for now.

## The Industry

Holy crap it's bad, no matter what part you're in layoffs and cost cutting has been hitting hard everywhere in tech. I will make a seprate post about this but, the current state of the industry has incentavized me to create my own path with game development. I've always had a passion for offensive security/red teaming but at least where I have worked I haven't really been allowed to do any sort of related work so I fall into burnout quickly. Now I am doing whitebox assessments nothing too fancy but it's better than before. In anycase this really desirves a "drunken rant post" later.

## Spring's Water

This may be a bit abstract but it's something I definitly need to yell into the void. I as of late feel like an impostor in tech. I feel like I should have done a more "creative" type job like writing, art, music etc. Currently I am praticing writing but I still have a long way to go. I want to start drawing again but I'm not sure if I have much time for that yet. I am attempting to shift what I have spent the past 6 years doing. At 18 I got oscp and thought I would have a long career in red teaming. Now I'm trying to shift to a completly different field on my own.

I think it's best to be like moving water. Sometimes life will take you into unexpected directions but as long as you keep flowing you will not become stangnant. As the small streams start to gather in the emerald hills of the woodlands of Persephone's domain, a mild tempest raised they offer a primordial lesson of flow. The hills may steer the water but they remain clear chasing a horizon into the unknown. There is wisdom to be had in the flowing water though perhaps it should not be the sole teacher.


or something like that


Anyways enjoy the pictures of Japan I took! More to come soon I swear this time!
