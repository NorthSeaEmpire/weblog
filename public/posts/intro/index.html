About Me
Currently I am a cybersecurity engineer. My primary background is in offensive security but I do all sorts of stuff related to the field.
Iv&rsquo;e done some more niche research in the field such as satellite security and android OS security. I am by  no means an expert but,
I fint it interesting nevertheless. Even though I am trying to move away from the security industry I may post infomation about sats and android here (from my own personal research).
There isn&rsquo;t a lot of info about sats in particular on the internet and there can be a few misconceptions to clear up as well. My main goal is to switch industries to
game design and development.">

<p>My other intrests outside of tech include: cooking, coffee, history, writing, photography, traveling, and scheming &gt;:)</p>
<h2 id="posting">Posting</h2>
<p>My main reason for the blog is to document my attempt at indie game development. I&rsquo;ll try to keep weekly posts, mainly to keep myself modavated.
However, I will probably post things about my other intrests too. Basically whatever I find interesting will go here.</p>
